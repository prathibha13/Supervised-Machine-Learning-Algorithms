# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

*Supervised learning* is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output.
This repository is a single site to the use cases of some common supervised machine learning algorithms.

The datasets links for the algorithms are given below:
